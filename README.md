Now i want to scale this chat application to multiple servers using Redis Pub/Sub.

Key Components:

1. Load Balancer
- Nginx with sticky sessions (essential for WebSocket connections)
- SSL termination
- WebSocket protocol support

3. Redis Layer
- Pub/Sub for cross-server message broadcasting
- Session store for user-socket mapping
- Temporary data caching

This design handles two critical scenarios:
1. User connections are distributed across multiple socket servers.
2. When a server goes down and connections are redistributed.


Here is the architecture diagram:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Clients
        C1[Client A]
        C2[Client B]
        C3[Client C]
    end

    subgraph Load Balancer
        LB[Nginx with Sticky Sessions]
    end

    subgraph Socket Servers
        S1[Socket Server 1]
        S2[Socket Server 2]
    end

    subgraph Redis
        RP[Redis Pub/Sub]
        RS[(Redis Session Store)]
    end

    subgraph Database
        DB[(MongoDB/PostgreSQL)]
    end

    C1 & C2 & C3 --> LB
    LB --> S1 & S2
    S1 & S2 <--> RP
    S1 & S2 --> RS
    S1 & S2 --> DB
```
